# Study Objectives 

- What are the effects of soil pH on redback salamanders abundance? 
- How does soil moisture affect the abundance of the redback salamanders? 
    - prediction: dry soils will have a lower abundance 
- What effect does air temperature have on abundance?
    - prediction: extreme temperatures will result in a lower abundance
- Does differences in soil temperature affect the redback salamander abundance?
- If redback salamander abundance indicts environment quality then degraded environments will see a lower abundance of redback salamanders
- How do the leadback and redback forms differ in their preferred habitats? 
- Do environment factors differentially affect the abundance of the two forms of redback salamander?
- Does the preferred environment differ between sites? 
- Over time, how does the abundance change?
- When there is environmental degradation at one sight, is there an increased abundance at another site?
- How do the observations differ between the observers who collected the data?
