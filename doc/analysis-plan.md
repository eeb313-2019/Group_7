# Possible analyses
- data transformation:
  - remove NAs 
  - remove french language columns
  - group by site and year, calculate annual soil pH, moisture, temperature, air temperature, daily rainfall
  - group by site, week, and year, calculate mean number of salamanders found weekly (as seen in Myles 2005) per year
- linear mixed effects model: 
  - we will use a linear model to test if habitat quality influences salamander abundance
  - response variable: salamander abundance
  - possible explanatory variables: avg annual soil pH, avg annual soil moisture, avg annual air temperature, avg annual rainfall (also as interactions)
- one-way anova
  - we will use an anova to test for differences in salamander abundance across sites
  - response variable: salamander abundance
  - explanatory variable: site

# Possible result tables 
- average soil pH, moisture, temperature, and air temperature at each site
- average abundance of the different morphs for different sites

# Possible result figures
- line graph:
  - air temperature over time 
  - salamander abundance over time
- scatterplot:
  - salamander abundance and how it changes with different soil pH levels
  - soil moisture and salamander abundance 
  - air temperature and salamander abundance 
- boxplot:
  - environmental factors (will need to specify) vs. two morph categories of red-backed salamanders
  - salamander abundance vs. the different sites
