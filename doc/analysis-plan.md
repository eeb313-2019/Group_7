# Possible analysis
-
# Possible result tables 
- average soil pH, moisture, temperature, and air temperature at each site
- average abundance of the different morphs for different sites

# Possible result figures
- line graph:
  - air temperature over time 
  - salamander abundance over time
- scatterplot:
  - salamander abundance and how it changes with different soil pH levels
  - soil moisture and salamander abundance 
  - air temperature and salamander abundance 
- boxplot:
  - environmental factors (will need to specify) vs. two morph categories of red-backed salamanders
  - salamander abundance vs. the different sites
