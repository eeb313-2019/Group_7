# Introduction to the project
Eastern red-backed salamanders are highly sensitive to their environments due to their respiratory physiology. As a result, they can be used as an indicator of environmental quality. 

An aim of the project is to see if environmental factors (rain, soil pH etc.) have an effect on salamander abundance in the Bruce Peninsula. Another would be to quantify potential differences between the two different morphs with respect to the environmenal variables. Additionally, we will assess if  differences in habitat quality across sites affect salamander abundance.

Because of the importance of salamanders in understanding greater ecosystem health, the questions this project aims to answer would be useful.


# Description of the data

The "salamander" dataset has information on Eastern Red-backed Salamander abundance across eight sites in the Bruce Peninsula. We will use the variables of rainfall, soil temperature, soil moisture, soil pH, and air temperature to evaluate the habitat quality across the different sites and test if the habitat influences salamander abundance. The data was collected by using artificial cover boards placed in a plot formation in each of the sites and then monitored for salamander presence over 3-8 weeks. NAs removed manually prior to use in R.
