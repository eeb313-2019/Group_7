# Introduction to the project
Eastern red-backed salamanders are highly sensitive to their environments due to their respiratory physiology. As a result, they can be used as an indicator of environmental quality. Acid rain is known to cause reductions in soil pH. Because salamanders would be sensitive to this, an interaction is to be expected. 

An aim of the project is to see if acid rain, through soil pH as a proxy, has an effect on the salamander abundance in this dataset. Another would be to quantify potential differences between the two different morphs with respect to the environmenal variables. It would be useful to also investigate other habitat variables like air temperature, and precipitation. 

Because of the importance of salamanders in understanding greater ecosystem health, the questions this project aims to answer would be useful.
