# Mock Figure Captions

## Figure 1
Abundance of salamanders according to site. We expect there to be some variation in the salamander abundance per site, over time. 
## Figure 2
Mean air temperature over time according to site. There is likely some increase in mean air temperature over time, per site as well, which may affect habitat quality and therefore salamander abundance. 
## Figure 3
Abundance of salamanders versus soil pH. Salamanders are very sensitive to soil pH. A pH that is too acidic would cause lower abundances, which is the pattern in the graph.
