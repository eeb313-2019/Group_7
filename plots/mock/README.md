# Mock Figure Captions

## Figure 1
We expect there to be some variation in the salamander abundance per site, over time. 
## Figure 2
There is likely some increase in mean air temperature over time, per site as well. 
## Figure 3
Salamanders are very sensitive to soil pH. A pH that is too acidic would cause lower abundances, which is the pattern in the graph.
